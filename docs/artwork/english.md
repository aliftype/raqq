## Last three _Suras_ of the _Quran_
The pages are laid out following the layout of Kufi _Mushafs_:
- _Sura_ titles are written in gold and outlines with a darker color, dotless and without vowel marks, and with eliminated inter-letter space to the point of overlap at times
- _Sura_ body starts with _Basmala_ immediately followed by the text of the _Sura_ without a separator.
- Space between calligraphic syllables equal to the inter-word space
- Lines are broken between calligraphic syllables
- Red, rounded dots for vowel marks, and rectangular dots in the text color for diacritical dots
- Ornamental gold dots for _ayah_ mark, with each five _ayahs_ marked with a big ornamental circle with the word “خمس” (five) inside it written in a style similar to _Sura_ title
- Excessive elongation to justify the text line
